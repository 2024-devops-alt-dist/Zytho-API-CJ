# Jimmy's review
Camille's project is very well done; there were no difficulties in launching it. The CRUD operations have been implemented for all the tables, which is a lot of work! :)
The README is clear and precise.
To take it a step further, I would recommend putting the environment variables in a hidden .env file and enclosing the commands in the README with triple backticks to make them easier to copy.
Great job! ⭐️🚀
